{"name":"Postslate","tagline":"A video post-production tool for synchronizing media clips","body":"# Postslate:  What is it?\r\n\r\nPostslate is a tool for use in video post-production.  Its main purpose is to help you match and synchronize video segments recorded by a camera with audio clips captured by a separate recorder.\r\n\r\nPostslate works by detecting and matching the \"clap\" sounds from a slate.\r\n\r\n(insert slate image here)\r\n\r\nThe Postslate tool allows you to preview and adjust matches between video and audio clips, and to prepare the clips for use in editing.\r\n\r\n(insert GUI image here)\r\n\r\nOnce synchronized, the camera video and external audio are trimmed and optionally merged together.  Merging involves repackaging streams without transcoding them, so there is no loss of quality.\r\n\r\nAll of Postslate's operations are non-destructive:  Postslate NEVER deletes or modifies your original media clips.  It only reads them.\r\n\r\n# Application\r\n\r\nIn its current form, Postslate can be useful in your video production efforts if:\r\n* the camera video is in a form usable by ![FFMPEG](http://www.ffmpeg.org) (quite likely);\r\n* the video clips include audio (albeit inferior) captured by a camera microphone;\r\n* the externally-recorded audio clips are in WAV format.\r\n\r\n# Download\r\n\r\nThe latest stable version of Postslate is 0.1.  You may download is as a ![gzipped tar file](tgz link) or as a ![ZIP archive](zip link).\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\nPostslate is written in Java and should work on virtually any modern system.\r\n\r\nPostslate requires a Java virtual machine, version 6 or higher.  There are many JRE\r\ndistributions freely available.  If you don't already have one, please see\r\n![this list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Java_virtual_machines).\r\n\r\nBefore installing Postslate, you need to make sure that the FFMPEG package is installed.\r\nIf you don't already have it, see ![the FFMPEG website](http://ffmpeg.org/download.html).\r\nVersion 2.0 or higher is strongly recommended.\r\n\r\nIf you want to modify Postslate, you should also have the ![Ant build tool](http://ant.apache.org) installed, or else be prepared to use your own tool--e.g., Eclipse.\r\n\r\nThe easiest installation is simple to unpack the distribution file (i.e., postslate-*.tar.gz)\r\nand to launch it using the included postslate script (Mac/Linux/Unix).\r\nOn Windows, run postslate.bat .\r\n\r\nFrom the Mac/Linux/Unix/Cygwin command line, you can also use the commands\r\n`./configure [--prefix=path]`\r\n`make`\r\n`make install`\r\nfamiliar to many users of free software.\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\nTo get started, please see the ![tutorial](https://github.com/newasptech/postslate/wiki/Quick-Tutorial).\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\nCopyright (C) 2014 New Aspect Technologies, Inc.
